# funeral-updates

This Python script is a simple Flask web application that allows users to sign up for text message updates about a funeral. When a user enters their phone number, the application stores it in a dictionary along with the current time. The application then sends a text message to the user using Twilio's API.

There is also an admin panel that allows the funeral home to update the message to include the name of the deceased, the location of the funeral, and the location of the cemetery. The admin panel also includes a button to clear the list of users who have signed up.

In addition to the basic functionality, the application includes a virtual guest book feature, which allows visitors to leave messages of condolence for the family. The messages are stored in a list and displayed on the website.

The HTML templates for the application are included in the templates folder, while the static files (including the CSS stylesheets and images) are stored in the static folder.

Overall, the application is designed to be simple and easy to use, while providing a valuable service to funeral home clients and their families.
